# coding challenge

Instructions:

You'll need to have `phantomjs` installed; I used homebrew for MacOS:

```
$ brew install phantomjs
```

Now make a virtualenv and install the included `requirements.txt`:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Finally, run the python script:

```
$ ./email_finder_danob.py http://www.mit.edu
```
